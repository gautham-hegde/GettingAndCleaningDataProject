Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
====================================
Project Description
-------------------
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

Steps
----------
- Get the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- Unzip the dataset in the same location as the run_analysis.R file such that there is a folder called UCI HAR Dataset
-source the run_analysis.R file

Output
---------
Two text files are produced as the output of this script
tidy_data_set.txt - result of step 4
tidy_data_average.txt - result of step 5
